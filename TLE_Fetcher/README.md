# Packet Collector

Gpredict only allows fetching TLEs from one web server. This script is designed to consolidate TLEs from multiple sources into a single file. I have this in a cron on my computer so fresh TLEs are always in a destination file for me to grab. I hope to update this into Python at some point, but for now it remains a Bash script.

Comments, suggestions, edits, and tips are welcome and appreciated.
