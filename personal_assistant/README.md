# Packet Collector

This is a basic housekeeping mailer designed to send reminders from the "remind" package, tasks (from "taskwarrior"), ip info (both internal and external), temperature, and uptime info.
For me, this command is on a cron, giving me an update daily.

Comments, suggestions, edits, and tips are welcome and appreciated.

### Usage
```
-h, --help      display this help and exit
-e, --email     specify the email to send the message to
-s, --subject   specify the subject for the email to have
-v              verbose output
```
